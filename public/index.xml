      <description>How do you price details? We quote based off vehicle size, and condition. Since it can be difficult to assess the condition of the vehicle over the phone we&amp;rsquo;ll give you a price range of what the cost could be. Upon seeing the vehicle we can give an absolute amount and promise not to raise the price after completing the job. All quotes are valid for 30 days.
Do you accept credit cards?</description>
